                    Climate change is a pressing global issue, characterized by rising temperatures, melting ice 
                    caps, and increasing extreme weather events, driven primarily by human activities such as 
                    deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels. Understanding its causes, impacts, and the 
                    urgent need for action is crucial to safeguarding our environment for future generations.

                        <h4>What is Climate Change?</h4>
                        <p>
                            &emsp;Climate change refers to significant changes in average weather conditions—such 
                            as becoming warmer, wetter, or drier—over several decades or more. This long-term 
                            trend distinguishes climate change from natural weather variability. Its effects
                            are diverse, including record floods, raging storms, and deadly heat, impacting 
                            all living beings, but not equally. Economically disadvantaged communities and 
                            people of color, who contribute the least to its causes, suffer the most from its 
                            impacts. The basics include understanding the causes of climate change, its effects 
                            on the planet and people, and potential solutions.

                        <h4>What is Climate Change and Global Heating?<br/>How Does it Work to Affect Our Lives?</h4>
                        <p>
                            &emsp;Climate change, or global warming, results from Earth's average temperature 
                            increase due to rising greenhouse gas concentrations and human-induced emissions. 
                            Greenhouse gases such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide,                 
                            and ozone trap heat radiation in the atmosphere, intensifying warming by 
                            absorbing and emitting heat. This phenomenon alters global climate patterns, 
                            driven primarily by human activities, with scientific consensus attributing 
                            over 95% of observed warming to these factors.

                        <h4>The climate crisis: the causes, the effects and the solutions</h4>
                        <p>
                            &emsp;Climate change has always existed, but the past 150 years of global warming are unusual 
                            due to human activity, known as the anthropogenic greenhouse effect. This began with the 
                            industrial revolution, leading to a dramatic rise in carbon dioxide levels, now at 410-415 
                            ppm compared to the historical 200-180 ppm. Monitored by observatories like Mauna Loa, data 
                            analyzed by the IPCC over the past 15 years confirms that global warming is due to human activity, 
                            a link first established by Svante Arrhenius and later confirmed by David Keeling in the 1960s.

                        <h4>The Arctic and the Philippines: An Unexpected Connection</h4>
                        <p>
                            &emsp;As the Arctic warms, it impacts global weather patterns and sea 
                            levels, directly affecting island nations like the Philippines. The 
                            accelerated melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet is a major contributor 
                            to rising sea levels, which, combined with cyclones, floods, and 
                            droughts, poses serious threats to coastal communities in the Philippines. 
                            Annual temperature and rainfall variations in the country are notably 
                            influenced by El Niño and La Niña phenomena. The melting Arctic sea ice 
                            is expected to contribute to more frequent and intense El Niño events, 
                            exacerbating temperature rises and leading to issues like water scarcity 
                            and drought.

                    <p>
                        Single-use plastics (SUPs) represent a throwaway culture that harms the 
                        environment and human health. They pollute water bodies, harm marine life, 
                        clog drainage systems, and release toxic gases during production, 
                        transportation, and disposal. Plastics have long lifetimes, with bottles 
                        lasting around 450 years. Instead of biodegrading, they break down into 
                        microplastics, which are ingested by fish and enter the human food chain.

                        Between 2010 and 2014, The Media Alliance managed the "Redraw the Line" 
                        campaign to raise public awareness of climate change in the Philippines, 
                        Thailand, Vietnam, and later Bangladesh. Supported by Sida and ADB, the 
                        campaign aimed to raise awareness of climate change factors, encourage 
                        demand for environmentally responsible products, and promote behavior 
                        changes in consumption practices.

                    <h4>Filipino youth mobilise for climate justice</h4>
                    <p>
                        YACAP is an alliance of Filipino youth organizations, student councils, 
                        and individuals fighting against climate change and pursuing climate 
                        justice. Established in 2019 as the counterpart of Fridays for Future 
                        in the Philippines, YACAP has chapters nationwide and aims to expand 
                        further. They engage youth and frontline communities in climate education, 
                        advocate for alternatives to problematic government policies, and 
                        collaborate with global activists to drive systemic change. YACAP 
                        organizes activities like social media campaigns, strikes, education 
                        programs, and a podcast on the climate crisis. Recent initiatives include 
                        the Youth Climate Agenda 2022, promoting green leadership in national 
                        elections, and the Global Climate Strike in March 2022.

                    <p>
                        The RAPID Program, an expansion of Project Climate Twin Phoenix, 
                        supported long-term recovery for LGUs and communities in Yolanda-affected 
                        areas along San Pedro Bay and Leyte Gulf. It focused on risk management, 
                        including risk assessments, emergency preparedness, disaster risk reduction, 
                        and improved regulatory frameworks. Running from 2014 to 2019, it was funded 
                        by the Australian Government and implemented by UNDP with CCC as the lead agency. 
                        The program's culminating activity was on July 12, 2019.

                        <h4>Oil and Gas Assets at Risk</h4>
                        <p>
                            &emsp;The study indicates that even with current and moderate global climate policies, 
                            the international oil and gas sector will undergo significant structural changes over 
                            the next two decades. This shift poses challenges for U.S. regions heavily dependent 
                            on these industries, which may struggle to remain economically competitive. Global oil
                            demand is expected to decline, particularly if electric vehicles gain market share as 
                            anticipated. Similarly, U.S. gas production faces challenges despite stable global demand.
                            The study emphasizes the need for federal policies to support economic diversification and
                            workforce reorganization in affected communities, ensuring they can adapt during the 
                            transition to cleaner energy sources.

                        <h4>The Politics of Climate Change</h4>
                        <p>
                            &emsp;Environmental groups are grappling with their response to the Waxman-Markey 
                            climate bill, officially known as H.R. 2454, the American Clean Energy and Security 
                            Act of 2009 (ACES). This comprehensive legislation, nearly 1,000 pages long, is moving
                            through the House of Representatives with a coalition that seems sufficient for passage,
                            although challenges are anticipated in the Senate. Compromises made to garner support 
                            in the House have been difficult for many environmental organizations to accept. Some 
                            have outright opposed the bill, others demand it be strengthened before they will support 
                            it, and some have taken a neutral stance. Meanwhile, business-oriented environmental groups
                            like NRDC and EDF have voiced strong support for the bill.

                        <p>
                            &emsp;Improving the energy efficiency of homes in the UK is critical, as they lose heat 
                            much faster than those in many European countries, largely due to widespread use of gas 
                            boilers. Currently, homes account for 15 to 20 percent of the nation's carbon emissions,
                            highlighting the urgency of decarbonizing properties to meet legally binding net zero
                            targets. Transitioning to low-carbon homes not only reduces emissions but also decreases 
                            reliance on fossil fuels, enhancing energy affordability and security while generating
                            thousands of jobs nationwide. A report by WWF and ScottishPower, "Better Homes, Cooler 
                            Planet," underscores the additional benefits: installing solar panels, heat pumps,
                            batteries, and electric vehicle charging points, alongside energy efficiency upgrades,
                            can increase property values by an average of £10,000 across England and Wales,
                            with some homes experiencing even greater appreciation.
